            <h2>Selected Projects</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Deep Neural Network Compression:</b> Proposed a novel CNN pruning criterion based on explainable AI ideas and relevance scores of important components, achieving a 10x reduction in model size with minimal drop in accuracy. Demonstrated superior performance in transfer-learning setups and established a link between model compression and interpretability research. Showed effectiveness in pruning the VGG16 model in CIFAR100 Dataset, and highlighted the usefulness in resource-constrained scenarios where fine-tuning is not feasible.</li>
                <li><b>Detecting Abusive Comments in Multiple Languages: A Multilingual Approach:</b> This project aims to automatically identify abusive comments in social media data using Machine Learning techniques. Utilized pre-trained language models such as MURIL to generate meaningful embeddings for comments in multiple Indian languages, and trained a fully connected neural network to predict whether a comment is abusive or non-abusive. Also evaluated the model’s performance using various metrics and explored the impact of training the model on subsets of languages.</li>
                <li><b>Efficient Image compression using FFT and wavelets:</b> Proposed new methods for image compression using fast Fourier transform (FFT), set partitioning in hierarchical trees, and HAAR wavelet, with a focus on FFT followed by HAAR wavelet using the embedded zero tree wavelet technique. Analyzed several image compression techniques and compared their performance using MATLAB software and parameters such as mean square error and peak signal-to-noise ratio. Emphasized the simplicity of implementation and memory efficiency of the proposed techniques, while also comparing them to existing methods.</li>
                <li><b>Online Workers Hiring System: </b>Designed and developed a software prototype for an Online Workers Hiring System using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Java. Successfully presented the prototype at a departmental seminar, showcasing its features and functionality to an audience of peers and experts.</li>
            </ul>
            <h2>Published Papers</h2>
            <ul>
                <li><b>Various Dynamic Programming Methods to Solve Optimization Problems: </b>Published a paper titled ”Various Dynamic Programming Methods to Solve Optimization Problems”, highlighting different optimization techniques and their respective examples.
