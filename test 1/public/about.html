<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Sai Krishna Sangeetha and currently I am pursing my Master's degree in Computer Science at the University of Central Florida. My course work is more focussed on algorithms, machine learning, natural language processing, and data preparation, Computer Vision and 3D Computer Vision. Prior to that, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Information and Communication Technology at SASTRA University in India. </p>

<p>I am proficient in various programming languages such as Python, R, MySQL, Ruby, and Java, and have experience with ML frameworks such as OpenCV, NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, NTLK, SpaCy, PyTorch, Keras, and Scikit-Learn. In addition, I have worked with various tools such as Docker, AWS, ETL, MongoDB, and Tableau.</p>

<p>After completing my Under Graduation, I worked as a Software Development Engineer at Freshworks Inc. for 3 years, where I was involved in developing and implementing features to streamline the CI/CD pipeline, improving the overall quality and reliability of releases by proactively managing potential risks and optimizing the release process. I also automated several processes and wrote automation scripts for UI and APIs, and conducted data analysis by querying product data using SQL and ETL systems. I have used adaptive machine learning technique in Release Process Automation, for which I have received appreciation across the organisation.</p>

<p>Apart from my professional experience, I have also worked on several interesting projects during my studies. For instance, I proposed a novel CNN pruning criterion based on explainable AI ideas and relevance scores of important components, which achieved a 10x reduction in model size with minimal drop in accuracy. I have also worked on projects related to detecting abusive language in multiple languages, efficient image compression using FFT and wavelets, and designed and developed a software prototype for an Online Workers Hiring System.</p>

<p>In my free time, I enjoy reading books and learning about new technologies and innovations in the field of Computer Science. I am excited about the prospect of applying my skills and knowledge to new challenges and working with like-minded individuals to achieve common goals.</p>
